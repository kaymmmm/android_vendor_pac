Dear Maintainers!

It's time to get to work. :P
We're updating our boot animations and how we apply them. It's really way easier!

So we all know our devices resoultion, and sometimes android DPI (mdpi, ldpi, hdpi, xhdpi, etc) doesn't always mean a specific size and there for not a solid experience for boot animations.

With out new system you just select the screen size, reading the folder as width x height.
(yes it's width by height, this is because that's how the desc file defines it in the files ;P )
